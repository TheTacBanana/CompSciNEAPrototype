Created a world class
Started with random grid of numbers
Displayed it as a grayscale image
Tried to implement a recursive function to smooth out the random generation
It would round the heights to within 0.1 of the heights surrounding it
This didnt work at all
Then worked on an averaging function which worked better, but didnt get the final result
Then implemented the upneutraldown function
Running these only once worked okayish, but didnt work fully
Upon second thought i ran them multiple times, defined in the parameters json file
This worked so much better and produced a convincing heightmap and colour map
Spent time tweaking values for the colour map, this took time but turned out well in the end
Added a screenshot function, so i can easily take screenshots for the writeup
Theres definitely still more things which could be tweaked
